# Code Description
The following repository includes codes in which www.fbref.com data is used for player/team analysis, the match analysis code uses data that can be found on www.whoscored.com. The data taken from these two websites are webscraped, the codes can be found in the data collection folder. 

At the moment there are five files that we'd like to include in our repository. The first includes player data collection code (player_webscrape) which includes data retrieved from www.stathead.com using the login that Mauricio created (modify at a later date). The second is player visualizations code (player_visualizations) which include scatterplots, bargraphs and pie charts. It would be great to expand this further at a later date. The third code (team_webscrape) is used to webscrape team data from the FBref website this could be used for basic statistics such as a teams xG, npxG etc. Fourth code (team_visualizations) once again visualizes team statistics, although we should look towards incorporating whoscored data into team visualizations in order to improve the portrayal of our analysis. Lastly, the matchday visualizations code (matchday_visualizations) should be used for specific games, such as the first analytics Offside/Onside article written on a specific match which was the Napoli vs AC Milan game that ended 2-2. It's imperative we find other means to visualize this data as it's what drives larger audiences.
