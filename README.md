# FBref-Data-Analysis
The following repository includes five codes that include FBref data to use for player/team analysis, then match analysis that uses data that can be found on whoscored.com. 
This repository takes inspiration from multiple other github repositories such as; 

- griffis_soccer_analysis (@griffisben)
- Football-Analytics-And-Visualizations (@Abhilashup)

What we do in this repository is that we modify these codes to match standards that we at Offside/Onside require. This includes update visualizations to match our prefered template and modifying code to retrieve data that's important for the analysis we'd like to do in this publication.
